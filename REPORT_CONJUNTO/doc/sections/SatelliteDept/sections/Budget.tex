\paragraph{}The difference between the total cost and the total estimation is due to the fact that every satellite has to go through a process to be ready for operation. This is, the CubeSat has to be assembled and has to be tested as well to ensure that all the systems are working properly. Thus, an estimation of the costs related with this operation has to be made.

\paragraph{}The fixed cost for assembling the satellites will be 150000\euro (cost of renting the building, the electricity, ...) and an additional cost 20000\euro $ / unit$, which will include the wages of the people assembling and testing the satellite and also other variable costs that may appear in the process, is added to every satellite. Furthermore, this extra 20000\euro includes the costs of transport to launch site.

\paragraph{}Several options have been studied for assembling and testing the satellite, and the option chosen is \textit{OpenCosmos}. Astrea is committed to encourage the growth of the local economy and we are sure that \textit{OpenCosmos} would be a perfect partner for the mission. They provide companies and individuals with simple and affordable access to space offering integration and testing services.
