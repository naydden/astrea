abstract = {Quadcopter control is a fundamentally difficult and interesting problem. With six de- grees of freedom (three translational and three rotational) and only four independent inputs (rotor speeds), quadcopters are severely underactuated. In order to achieve six degrees of freedom, rotational and translational motion are coupled. The resulting dynamics are highly nonlinear, especially after accounting for the complicated aerodynamic effects. Finally, unlike ground vehicles, helicopters have very little friction to prevent their motion, so they must pro- vide their own damping in order to stop moving and remain stable. Together, these factors create a very interesting control problem. We will present a very simplified model of quad- copter dynamics and design controllers for our dynamics to follow a designated trajectory.We will then test our controllers with a numerical simulation of a quadcopter in flight},

abstract = {Thin-film crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells with light-trapping structures can enhance light absorption within the semiconductor absorber layer and reduce material usage. Here we demonstrate that an inverted nanopyramid light-trapping scheme for c-Si thin films, fabricated at wafer scale via a low-cost wet etching process, significantly enhances absorption within the c-Si layer. A broadband enhancement in absorptance that approaches the Yablonovitch limit (Yablonovitch, E. J. Opt. Soc. Am.1987, 72, 899–907 ) is achieved with minimal angle dependence. We also show that c-Si films less than 10 $\mu$m in thickness can achieve absorptance values comparable to that of planar c-Si wafers thicker than 300 $\mu$m, amounting to an over 30-fold reduction in material usage. Furthermore the surface area increases by a factor of only 1.7, which limits surface recombination losses in comparison with other nanostructured light-trapping schemes. These structures will not only significantly curtail both the material and proc...},

abstract = {One of the more daunting tasks of designing a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is the selection of a propulsion system that will provide desired performance. Rigorous methods for selecting these drive components, that is, the motors, propellers, and batter-ies for electric UAVs are not readily available. Currently, many UAV designs are based on legacy selections or limited and at times incorrect manufacturer data. These design methods are either simplistic or lacking in analysis and validation of component selection. Proper propulsion system design should address the mission requirements for which the vehicle is being designed. A proper design methodology is the best chance that the designer has to create a new vehicle that will be mission-capable. This paper attempts to satisfy the need for more thorough method of propulsion component selection. The paper is written also to document the popular online drive system analysis tool due to numerous requests. This tool is one example implementation of the methodologies described by this paper.

For this purpose, we use poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) which leads to an electrically well connected silver nanowire (AgNW) network. Furthermore, the use of water based PEDOT: PSS leads to humidity assisted AgNW fusing, resulting in a maximum processing temperature of only 120 °C. OPV cells using this AgNW/PEDOT: PSS transparent electrodes exhibit power conversion efficiencies up to 7.15{\%}. Moreover, OPV devices on PET substrates with an alumina encapsulation and barrier adhesive show excellent mechanical flexibility.},

abstract = {This thesis presents an approach for the optimization of the propulsion system of an unmanned lightweight quadrotor by introducing rotor aerodynamics and identifying methods to improve the electrical propulsion system (EPS), hence improving its performance and efficiency. Since the rotor is the main component to generate thrust, a numerical model based on the combined momentum and blade element theory is presented to aid in the design and/or selection of the optimum rotor. In order to validate this numerical model and to benchmark the different system solutions, a propulsion test bench was built to collect experimental data from a series of tests carried out in the lab. Rotors of 11 and 13 inches of diameter and of different brands were tested under the same environmental conditions with rotational velocities ranging from 4000 to 8000 rpm in hover situation. The measured thrust and power were compared to the theoretical thrust output and required power, and the average discrepancy between both results was estimated to be 4.6{\%} in terms of thrust and to 24.3{\%} in terms of power. The design and optimization of the EPS is an iterative procedure; consequently, an optimization workflow method is proposed, since propulsion improvements mainly depend on the optimum combination of the propeller, motor and battery.},

This edition includes more recent developments in space exploration (e.g., Galileo, Cassini, Mars Odyssey missions). Also, the chapter on space debris was rewritten to reflect new developments in that area. The well-organized chapters cover every basic aspect of orbital mechanics, from celestial relationships to the problems of space debris. The book is clearly written in language familiar to aerospace professionals and graduate students, with all of the equations, diagrams, and graphs you would like to have close at hand. An updated software package on CD-ROM includes: "HW Solutions, " which presents a range of viewpoints and guidelines for solving selected problems in the text; "Orbital Calculator, "which provides an interactive environment for the generation of Keplerian orbits, orbital transfer maneuvers, and animation of ellipses, hyperbolas, and interplanetary orbits; and "Orbital Mechanics Solutions."},

abstract = {The fifth edition of Behrouz Forouzan's Data Communications and Networking presents a comprehensive and accessible approach to data communications and networking that has made this book a favorite with students and professionals alike. More than 830 figures and 150 tables accompany the text and provide a visual and intuitive opportunity for understanding the material. This unique approach minimizes the need for heavy math content, allowing normally complicated topics to unfold graphically and visually rather than through the presentation of complex formulas. The new edition has been reorganized to showcase recent developments in the field and minimize or eliminate coverage of deprecated topics. In addition to the updated material included in each chapter, the text now features a chapter on the peer-to-peer paradigm, a full chapter on quality of service (QoS), additional coverage of forward error correction, coverage of WiMAX, and material on socket-interface programming in Java. The end-of-chapter material has also been significantly enhanced and now includes more than 630 questions, 600 problems, many lab assignments, programming assignments, and online applets that allow students to see problems and protocols in action. Technologies related to data communications and networking are among the fastest growing in our culture today, and there is no better guide to this rapidly expanding field than Behrouz Forouzan, an author whose visual, student-friendly approach has become a hallmark in a computer science instruction.},

abstract = {Intersatellite links or crosslinks provide direct connectivity between two or more satellites, thus eliminating the need for intermediate ground stations when sending data. Intersatellite links have been considered for satellite constellation missions involving earth observation and communications. Historically, a large satellite system has needed an extremely high financial budget. However, the advent of the successful CubeSat platform allows for small satellites of less than one kilogram. This low-mass pico-satellite class platform could provide financially feasible support for large platform satellite constellations. This article surveys past and planned large intersatellite linking systems. Then, the article chronicles CubeSat communication subsystems used historically and in the near future. Finally, we examine the history of inter-networking protocols in space and open research issues with the goal of moving towards the next generation intersatellite-linking constellation supported by CubeSat platform satellites.},

Three Major Qualifying Projects (MQP) representing seven subsystems collaborated on the construction of a ground-based CubeSat to test current technologies and investigate the feasibility of future CubeSat projects at WPI. Of the seven CubeSat subsystems, this report outlines efforts of the power, propulsion, and structure subsystems. Research on previous and current CubeSat projects provided baseline information, giving teams the ability to select components for a “Lab Option” as well as “Flight Option” CubeSat. Although construction and testing of a full Lab Option CubeSat was beyond the scope of this project, each of the three subsystems teams were able to design and/or construct a baseline set of components for their subsystem and perform rudimentary testing. The extensive research and recommendations detailed herein will be used by future groups to prepare a space-ready satellite. In addition, this project (in conjunction with two other CubeSat design teams) resulted in a fully defined Flight Option CubeSat, including component selection and mission planning, for a 3U CubeSat carrying an Infrared Spectrometer},

abstract = {This thesis researches the potential of using a distributed architecture for the cubesat power system. There are several key advantages of a distributed architecture that are desirable. Design reuse is one well known advantage and it is exploited almost exclusively in larger spacecraft. However, since the first cubesats were very simplistic in their electrical power system design, custom centralized architectures were initially selected and made sense. As the cubesat standard begins to proliferate, the need to have a non-custom, generic electrical power system design that can be reused over and over again is needed to support the ever increasing design complexities. To begin the research, an electrical power system survey is discussed that provides insight into the current state-of-the-art in cubesat electrical power system design. Next, an actual cubesat electrical power system design based on the centralized architecture is broken down into its individual components. A complementary design is then created using a distributed architecture. The two designs are analyzed, compared, and contrasted. The results are presented and discussed as part of the research.},

abstract = {The increasing demands of position information have made the wireless location technology catch more and more attention nowadays. GPS (Global Positioning System) which has been widely used cannot localize successfully indoors and among buildings, its defects are increasingly prominent. Given the acceptable terrestrial digital television signals anytime and anywhere, as well as the advantages of high transmission power, low operating frequency and strict synchronization with absolute time, it is possible to achieve accurate positioning by Digital Television Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) and GPS. Electromagnetic waves have to propagate by deflection, refraction and scattering because of the obstructions in the surroundings of transmitting, we call it as Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) propagation, which results in NLOS errors [1]. In this paper we take some further study on the method of NLOS error mitigation based on the hybrid positioning system combining DTMB and GPS in view of a large number of obstacles in the urban environment. This algorithm, referred to as Range Dynamic Compensation and Linear Line of Position Joint Algorithm, can predict the next position of the object, which can be used to compensate the actual measured value for the purpose of reducing the NLOS errors. The Linear Line of Position Algorithm which utilizes the linear statistical location techniques straightforward rather than linearizing the system roughly is then applied to simplify the position coordinates calculations as well as mitigate the residual NLOS errors. The simulation testing result indicates that this joint algorithm significantly improved the location precision in areas with serious NLOS contamination. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

The purpose of the project is to provide a standard for design of picosatellites to reduce cost and development time, increase accessibility to space, and sustain frequent launches. Presently, the CubeSat Project is an international collaboration of over 100 universities, high schools, and private firms developing picosatellites containing scientific, private, and government payloads. A CubeSat is a 10 cm cube with a mass of up to 1.33 kg. Developers benefit from the sharing of information within the community.
