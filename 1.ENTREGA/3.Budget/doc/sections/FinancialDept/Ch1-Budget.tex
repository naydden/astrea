\chapter{Introduction}
The aim of a budget is to provide reliable information about the estimation of the expenses required in order to start and carry out a new company such as Astrea.

Astrea's situation is kind of unusual, due to the fact that the company is not selling a defined physical product, but a service. To do so, a widespread constellation of cubesats is deployed around the whole Earth. This situation obviously requires of a certain maintenance and eventually a complete renewal. In other words, over the years, some other investments must be carried on. 

In particular, in the year 0 of Astrea's life (this is, the planning and beginning) there are many different costs such as the engineering hours, the communications' first investment, the satellites building and launching, amongst many others. Nevertheless, 5 years from that point (this is, year 5) the life of the satellites is expected to be getting over, and in order to prevent fails on the service, a replacement strategy is done. In year 4 new satellites will be built and in year 5 they will be re-launched, so as to fill the constellation again. This will mean that a second budget is done for the year 4, including both building and launching. Again, in year 9, the same phenomenom will occur, and so on. 

Therefore, two different budgets are going to be explained. The first one is the initial budget, and the second one is the periodic budget, which must be invested every 5 years from the beginning of Astrea's life. 

All the costs stated in this document are in \euro. 

Without further ado, let's state the different costs of the project.


\chapter{Costs}
\section{Manpower}
The engineering hours were stated in the Project Charter together with the Gantt Chart. They are again synthesized in the following table. It must be taken into account that the salary of an Astrea's engineer is of \euro  per hour.

\section{Communication Costs}
The communications costs include the costs of building the Ground Stations and the Mission Control Center, and also the costs of maintenance and operation of them.
\subsection{Initial Investment}
The investment required for building each Ground Station is of 356000 \euro and the Mission Control Center of 3000000 \euro. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\toprule
\hline
\rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
	 & Cost \\ \hline
	GS Canada & 356000 \\ \hline
	GS Malvines & 356000 \\ \hline
	GS Scotland & 356000 \\ \hline
	MCC Spain & 3000000 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.65}
	Total & 4068000 \\ \hline
\bottomrule

\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\subsection{Maintenance and Operation Costs}
The following costs are associated to operation resources and general maintenance:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | l | }
\toprule
\hline
\rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
	Concept & MCC & GS Canada & GS Scoltand & GS Malvines \\ \hline
	Energy & 20540 & 4550 & 9100 & 9100 \\ \hline
	Maintenance & 7500 & 7500 & 7500 & 7500 \\ \hline
	Internet & 660 & 660 & 660 & 660 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.65}
	Total & 28700 & 12710 & 17260 & 17260 \\ \hline
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

And also the costs associated to salaries of the operators:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\toprule
\hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
	Concept & Cost \\ \hline
	Salaries GS Canada & 381500 \\ \hline
	Salaries GS Scotland (UK) & 226400 \\ \hline
	Salaries GS Malvines & 81800 \\ \hline
	Salaries MCC & 429900 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.65}
	Total & 1119600 \\ \hline
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Nevertheless, those costs are annual, so they are not to be taken into account when estimating the budget, since they are not included in the initial investment. They will be subtracted from the profit of the company. 

\section{Satellites Costs}
The costs of the satellites can be splitted into two big groups: the costs associated to building each satellite and the costs associated to the assembling of them.

Let's start with the building costs for each satellite:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | }
\toprule
\hline
\rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
	Component & Units per satellite & Costs (unit) & Cost (satellite) \\ \hline
	Structure & 1 & 3900 & 3900 \\ \hline
	Thermal protection & 1 & 1000 & 1000 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.85}
	Electric power system &  & \  & \  \\ \hline
	Solar arrays & 4 & 17000 & 68000 \\ \hline
	Batteries & 2 & 6300 & 12600 \\ \hline
	Power management & 1 & 16000 & 16000 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.85}
	Payload &  & \  & \  \\ \hline
	1st Patch Antenna & 1 & 18000 & 18000 \\ \hline
	Patch antenna & 7 & 7000 & 49000 \\ \hline
	Antenna deployment & 1 & 3000 & 3000 \\ \hline
	Transciever inter-satellite & 3 & 8245 & 24735 \\ \hline
	Transciever space to ground & 1 & 5500 & 5500 \\ \hline
	Data handling system & 1 & 5000 & 5000 \\ \hline
	Variable expenses & 1 & 4000 & 4000 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.85}
	AOCDS &  & \  & \  \\ \hline
	Thruster & 1 & 50000 & 50000 \\ \hline
	CubeSpace ACDS & 1 & 15000 & 15000 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.65}
	Total &  & \  & 275735\  \\ \hline
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


Taking into account that there are 189 satellites in Astrea's constellation (21 satellites per plane, and 9 planes), the total building cost is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\toprule
\hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
	Cost of each satellite & Total cost \\ \hline
	275735 & 52113915 \\ \hline
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

There are also the assembling cost of the satellites:


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | }
\toprule
\hline
\rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
	Concept & Cost per unit & Cost per constellation \\ \hline
	Individual Assembling & 20000 & 3780000 \\ \hline
	Constellation Assembling &  & 150000 \  \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.65}
	Total Cost &  & 3930000 \  \\ \hline
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The conclusion is that the global cost of the satellites are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\toprule
\hline
\rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
	Concept & Costs  \ \\ \hline
	Building & 52113915 \\ \hline
	Assembling & 3930000 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.65}
	Total & 56043915 \ \\ \hline
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\section{Launching Costs}
There are 9 different planes of satellites orbiting the Earth. Each plane requires a different launcher. Therefore, there ir a cost associated to each launcher. Moreover, a fee must be paid too for every satellite carried on in the launcher. 

Consequently, the launching costs are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | }
\toprule
\hline
\rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
	Concept & Individual cost & Number of units & Total cost \\ \hline
	Launcher & 5361774 & 9 & 48255966 \\ \hline
	Satellites in launcher & 16000 & 189 & 3024000 \\ \hline
	\rowcolor[gray]{0.65}
	Total &  &  & 51279966 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\section{Other costs}

There are some other costs which are not taken into account when calculating the budget. Those costs are the salaries of the Ground Stations and the Main Control Center operators, the anual insurance cost, the administrarion cost, the supplies and the  maintenance of the host for the website, amongst some others. Those costs are to be paid anually, and therefore they are not included in the different investments. They will be subtracted from the profit of the company. 



\chapter{Budget}
As the introduction of the Budget has already explained, there will be two different budgets. The first one is the initial budget, required at the beginning of the project, and the second one is the periodic budget, required every 5 years from the beginning of the project.

\section{Initial Budget}
This budget is for the beginning of the project (year 0). At that point, the project is designed, the Ground Stations and the Main Control Center is designed, built and started, the satellites of the first cycle of the constellation are built and assembled and eventually launched. Therefore, the costs that must be taken into account are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Manpower (engineering hours): 395000 \euro .
\item Communications Initial Investment: 4068000 \euro .
\item Satellites building and assembling: 56043915 \euro .
\item Launching costs: 51279966 \euro .
\end{itemize}

Adding all those quantities, the initial budget turns out to be of 111786881 \euro. 

\section{Periodic Budget}
This budget is for every 5 years once the project is started (this is, year 4, 9, 14 and so on). At that point, the only cost is the one derived from the requirement of renewal of the constellation. Therefore, the costs are of building and assembling the satellites and launching them again:

\begin{itemize}
\item Satellites building and assembling: 56043915 \euro .
\item Launching costs: 51279966 \euro .
\end{itemize}

Adding all those quantities, the periodic budget turns out to be of 107323881 \euro. 

This budget could mean another investment required but also could come from the wide benefits that Astrea provides by time time. For further details, check the Feasibility Study.
