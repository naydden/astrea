It also identifies areas for developing and improving standards and provides a common reference for maintaining consistency among all related standards. The text was developed jointly with ISO/IEC and the main intent of this revision is to introduce the joint text, which incorporates inclusion of the concept of connectionless transmission, in addition to a number of technical and editorial refinements.},
