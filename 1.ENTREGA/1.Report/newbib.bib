@book{Chobotov2002,
abstract = {Designed to be used as a graduate student textbook and a ready reference for the busy professional, this third edition of "Orbital Mechanics" is structured so that you can easily look up the things you need to know. This edition includes more recent developments in space exploration (e.g., Galileo, Cassini, Mars Odyssey missions). Also, the chapter on space debris was rewritten to reflect new developments in that area. The well-organized chapters cover every basic aspect of orbital mechanics, from celestial relationships to the problems of space debris. The book is clearly written in language familiar to aerospace professionals and graduate students, with all of the equations, diagrams, and graphs you would like to have close at hand. An updated software package on CD-ROM includes: "HW Solutions, " which presents a range of viewpoints and guidelines for solving selected problems in the text; "Orbital Calculator, "which provides an interactive environment for the generation of Keplerian orbits, orbital transfer maneuvers, and animation of ellipses, hyperbolas, and interplanetary orbits; and "Orbital Mechanics Solutions."},

This handbook is an equally invaluable asset to those on a career path towards the space industry as it is to those already within the industry. About the Author Malcolm Macdonald is Associate Director of the Advanced Space Concepts Laboratory within the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Strathclyde. He studied for his PhD at the University of Glasgow from 2000–2002, prior to gaining a research assistant post until December 2004. From 2005–2008 he worked at SciSys UK Ltd. on a range of European Space Agency projects and missions, including ADM-Aeolus and LISA-Pathfinder, progressing to become a senior member of technical staff. Malcolm has diverse research interests, with activities spanning space and aerospace technology, including mission and system design, astrodynamics, and swarm and disaggregated system engineering. He also has interests in technology foresight, horizon scanning and roadmapping, and is a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Viorel Badescu is affiliated with the Candida Oancea Institute and a Professor in the Department of Engineering Thermodynamics at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest. His mainstream scientific contributions consist of about 250 papers and several books related to statistical physics, thermodynamics, the physics of semiconductors, the various aspects of terrestrial and space solar energy applications and other energy-related issues. Also, he has theorized on present-day Mars meteorology and Mars terraforming and on several macro-engineering projects. He has received four awards, including the Romanian Academy Prize for Physics in 1979. He is member of the Romanian Academy},

It was commissioned by NASA's Small Space- craft Technology Program (SSTP) in mid-2013 in response to the rapid growth in interest in using small spacecraft for many types of missions in Earth orbit and beyond. For the sake of this assessment, small spacecraft are defined to be spacecraft with a mass less than 180 kg. This report provides a summary of the state of the art for each of the following small spacecraft technology domains: Complete spacecraft, Power, Propulsion, Attitude Determination and Control, Structures, Ma- terials and Mechanisms, Thermal Control, Command and Data Han- dling, Communications, Integration, Launch and Deployment, and Ground Data Systems and Operations. Due to the high popularity of cubesats, particular emphasis is placed on the state-of-the-art of cubesat-related technology.},
