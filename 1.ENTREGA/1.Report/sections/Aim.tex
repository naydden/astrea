\chapter{Aim of the project}
To design a \textbf{satellite constellation} dedicated to  communications relay between LEO satellites and between LEO satellites and the ground. The constellation designed has to be able to adapt if a failure happens or if the satellite cannot communicate for different reasons (such as when maintaining orbit with the thruster ignited).

Additionally, part of the aim of the project is to establish a communication protocol for satellite-satellite and satellite-ground station communications as well as the placement of the latter. 

Launching and assembling the CubeSats will be performed by external companies; these tasks will be analyzed in the report.
