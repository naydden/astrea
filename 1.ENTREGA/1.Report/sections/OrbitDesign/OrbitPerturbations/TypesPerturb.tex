In this chapter it is seen how the orbit configuration varies in time due to external perturbation sources. While some of them can be neglected, there are other of major importance to the future of the constellation.

Even though most of the outer space is vacuum, the ideal models need to consider some factors that escape the typical two body problem. To enumerate, here is a typical list of the main perturbation sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Gravity Field of the Central Body:} due to the Earth's spherical shape as seen in \cite[Chapter 4, Section 1]{annex1}. This perturbation will not be considered because it does not affect Astrea constellation as shown in \cite[Chapter 4, Section 3]{annex1}
\item \textbf{Atmospheric Drag:} It is the perturbation caused by the remaining atmosphere. The study of the satellites orbit decay can be found in \cite[Chapter 4, Section 3]{annex1}. Even so, this effect is not taken into account because the satellites are equipped with thrusters.
\item \textbf{Third Body perturbations:} Perturbation computed in \cite[Chapter 4, Section 1]{annex1}
\item \textbf{Solar-Radiation Pressure:} Explained in \cite[Chapter 4, Section 3]{annex1}
\item \textbf{Other Perturbations}
\end{itemize}
