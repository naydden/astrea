%Example:

One of the main problems of putting a satellite in a low Earth orbit, is that its lifetime is very reduced. The easiest way to solve this problem would be increasing the height of the orbit, as it is discussed on the Annex REF TO ANNEX ORBIT DESIGN SECTION RAISING THE ORBIT HEIGHT TO INCREASE LIFETIME. However, there is another proposal that is useful for Astrea Constellation.
