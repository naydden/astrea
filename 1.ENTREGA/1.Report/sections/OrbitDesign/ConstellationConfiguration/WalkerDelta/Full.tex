A typical delta pattern has the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}

\item The constellation contains a total of \textit{T} satellites evenly spaced in each of the \textit{P} orbital planes. All planes have the same number of satellites, defined as \textit{S}, equally distributed. Thus:
\begin{equation}
T = SP
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Delta\varphi=\frac{2\pi}{S}
\end{equation}
Where $\Delta\varphi$ is the angle between satellites in the same plane.

\item All orbits have equal inclinations $\delta$ to a reference plane. If this plane is the Equator (it usually is), then the inclination $\delta$ equals the orbital parameter inclination \textit{i} \cite{Walker1971}.

\end{figure} 

\item The ascending nodes of the orbits are equally spaced across the full $2\pi$ (360$^{\circ}$ of longitude) at intervals of:
\begin{equation}
\Delta\Omega=\frac{2\pi}{P}
\end{equation}

\item The position of the satellites in different orbital planes is measured through the factor \textit{F}. When a satellite is at its ascending node, a satellite in the most easterly adjacent plane has covered a relative phase difference \textit{F}. The real phase difference is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta\Phi=F\frac{2\pi}{P}
\end{equation}
In order to have the same phase difference between all orbital planes, \textit{F} is defined as an integer, which may have any value from 0 to (P-1).

\end{itemize}

With these characteristics, delta constellations are more complex than polar constellations. Because of the inclination of the orbits, the ascending and descending planes and the coverage of the satellites continuously overlap. This characteristic is a constraint on intersatellite networking because the relative velocities between satellites in different orbital planes are larger than in a polar constellation. Consequently, tracking requirements and Doppler shift are increased \cite{Wood2001}.
