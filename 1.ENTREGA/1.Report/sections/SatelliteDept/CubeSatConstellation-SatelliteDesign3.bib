abstract = {Started in 1999, the CubeSat Project began as a collaborative effort between Prof. Jordi Puig-Suari at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo, and Prof. Bob Twiggs at Stanford University's Space Systems Development Laboratory (SSDL). The purpose of the project is to provide a standard for design of picosatellites to reduce cost and development time, increase accessibility to space, and sustain frequent launches. Presently, the CubeSat Project is an international collaboration of over 100 universities, high schools, and private firms developing picosatellites containing scientific, private, and government payloads. A CubeSat is a 10 cm cube with a mass of up to 1.33 kg. Developers benefit from the sharing of information within the community. If you are planning to start a CubeSat project, please contact Cal Poly. Visit the CubeSat website at http://cubesat.org for more information.},

@article{epsbasics,
abstract = {This thesis researches the potential of using a distributed architecture for the cubesat power system. There are several key advantages of a distributed architecture that are desirable. Design reuse is one well known advantage and it is exploited almost exclusively in larger spacecraft. However, since the first cubesats were very simplistic in their electrical power system design, custom centralized architectures were initially selected and made sense. As the cubesat standard begins to proliferate, the need to have a non-custom, generic electrical power system design that can be reused over and over again is needed to support the ever increasing design complexities. To begin the research, an electrical power system survey is discussed that provides insight into the current state-of-the-art in cubesat electrical power system design. Next, an actual cubesat electrical power system design based on the centralized architecture is broken down into its individual components. A complementary design is then created using a distributed architecture. The two designs are analyzed, compared, and contrasted. The results are presented and discussed as part of the research.},
