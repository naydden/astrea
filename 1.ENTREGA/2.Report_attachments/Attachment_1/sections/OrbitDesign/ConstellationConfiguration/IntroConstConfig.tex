\subsubsubsection*{The GPS Constellation: An example of irregular distributed orbits \cite{GPS}}
The GPS is a constellation property of the U.S. It provides positioning, navigation and timing. The constellation was designed with a 24-slot arrangement to ensure a visibility of at least four satellites from any point on the planet. Nowadays the constellation has expanded to a total operative number of 27-slot since June 2011. Some characteristic parameters of the satellites are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Orbit: Almost Circular
\item Height = 20,200 km (MEO);
\item Lifetime = 12.5 years;
\item Satellite Cost = 166 million USD;
\item Inclination = 55º;
\item Number of planes = 6;
\item Phasing: 30º-105º-120º-105º;
\end{itemize}
