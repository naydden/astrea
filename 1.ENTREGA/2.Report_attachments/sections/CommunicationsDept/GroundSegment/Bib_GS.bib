@article{DCCP,
abstract = {DCCP, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol, is a new transport protocol in the TCP/UDP family that pro- vides a congestion-controlled flowof unreliable datagrams. Delay-sensitive applications, such as streaming media and telephony, prefer timeliness to reliability. These applica- tions have historically used UDP and implemented their own congestion control mechanisms—a difficult task—or no congestion control at all. DCCP will make it easy to deploy these applications without risking congestion col- lapse. It aims to add to a UDP-like foundation the min- imum mechanisms necessary to support congestion con- trol, such as possibly-reliable transmission of acknowl- edgement information. This minimal design should make DCCP suitable as a building block for more advanced ap- plication semantics, such as selective reliability.We intro- duce and motivate the protocol and discuss some of its de- sign principles. Those principles particularly shed light on the ways TCP's reliable byte-stream semantics influence its implementation of congestion control.},

@article{HTTPS,
abstract = {Increased user concern over security and privacy on the Internet has led to widespread adoption of HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS authenticates the communicating end points and provides confidentiality for the ensuing communication. However, as with any security solution, it does not come for free. HTTPS may introduce overhead in terms of infrastructure costs, communication latency, data usage, and energy consumption. Moreover, given the opaqueness of the encrypted communication, any in-network value added services requiring visibility into application layer content, such as caches and virus scanners, become ineffective. This paper attempts to shed some light on these costs. First, taking advantage of datasets collected from large ISPs, we examine the accelerating adoption of HTTPS over the last three years. Second, we quantify the direct and indirect costs of this evolution. Our results show that, indeed, security does not come for free. This work thus aims to stimulate discussion on technologies that can mitigate the costs of HTTPS while still protecting the user's privacy.},

One such improvement which includes innovative new solutions is the Neighbour Discovery protocol of IPv6. It is the implementation of this protocol and the services it provides which are the primary focus of the following report, and also how it improves on the current level of service that equivalent IPv4 protocols provide.},

These features make SCTP a good candidate as a transport level protocol for MPI (Message Passing Interface). MPI is a message passing middleware that is widely used to parallelize scientific and compute intensive applications. TCP is often used as the transport protocol for MPI in both local area and wide area networks. Prior to this work, SCTP has not been used for MPI. We compared and evaluated the benefits of using SCTP instead of TCP as the underlying transport protocol for MPI. We re-designed LAM-MPI, a public domain version of MPI, to use SCTP.We describe the advantages and disadvantages of using SCTP, the necessary modifications to the MPI middleware to use SCTP, and the performance of SCTP as compared to the stock implementation that uses TCP.},
