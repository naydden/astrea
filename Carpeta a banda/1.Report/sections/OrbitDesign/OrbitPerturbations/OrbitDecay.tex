In this chapter the effects of the main perturbations are deeply studied. Firstly, an introduction on the effects of Earth's oblateness on the orbital parameters. Secondly and in more detail, the effects of Atmospheric drag. This is significant because it deviates the power and mass budget to engines and propellant.
