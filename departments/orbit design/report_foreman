\section{Orbital Design}

\subsection{Semi Walker Delta Configuration}
\paragraph{ }

In order to reduce the necessary costs to design this satellite-based constellation some other configurations will be discussed. The Walker Delta Configuration (WDC) represents the most general constellation for a given inclination different to 90 degrees, i.e. 75 degrees. The WDC is a uniform based 360 degree generated configuration with equidistant orbits, which implies a certain redundant Earth coverage as described in the previous chapter.However, this can and will be solved by generating a 180 degree constellation - Semi Walker Delta Configuration (SWDC) - which will also fulfill global coverage although having some inconvenients. 
\subsubsection{Advantages}\vfill

\paragraph{   }

-	\textbf{Distance between planes reduced.} With the SWDC constellation the redundant orbits are directly corrected, thus the distance between planes is reduced to half, as results from the geometry itself. \vfill

-	\textbf{Less number of planes needed.} This means that in order to approach global coverage fewer planes will be requiered due to the decrease in distance between planes.\vfill
 
-	\textbf{Satellites following the same direction - sense} With the SWDC constellation the orbits have no interaction with each other, thus the satellites for each orbit can be set following the same direction. This will significantly improve the communications among satellites from different planes; also, we will be avoiding the Doppler Effect. \vfill

\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
\paragraph{ }

-	\textbf{Gap configuration.} With the SWDC constellation the main problem is the gap that results from configuring the constellation at a given inclination and describing equidistant orbits. In order to fulfull global coverage this gap will have to be covered by means of auxiliar orbits. 
\paragraph{ }


\subsection{Mixed Walker Delta Configuration}
\paragraph{ }
As we have discussed for the SWDC, the main disadvantage respect to the Walker Delta Configuration is the fact that a gap is obtained, thus a global coverage network cannot be described. In order to cover the entire Earth we have analysed some ways of covering the gap with auxiliar orbits. 

\subsubsection{SWDC including an additional polar orbit.}
\paragraph{ }
This polar orbit would be set directly on top of the gap described by the SWDC. The main issue with polar orbits, as discussed before in this report, is the complex reorientation and decay in inclination that takes place. We must take into account these considerations when covering the entire Earth, especially if we only have one polar orbit in our constellation. 

\subsubsection{Mixed Walker Delta.}
\paragraph{ }
In order to avoid using polar orbits and their complex reorientations, we can contemplate adding planes to the SWDC. In result, different configurations distributed around the Earth can be described and set in order to fulfill global coverage. As discussed before, the SWDC constellation is generated around 180 degrees whereas the Walker Delta Constellation is a 360 degree generated configuration. This Mixed Walker Delta (MWDC) is the result of adding some planes to the SWDC, thus a constellation can be generated for different degree values, such as 200, 225, 240, etc. 

\paragraph{ }


After different mathematical approaches and optimal solutions, the department of Orbital Design considered that the best option in order to have a global coverage constellation with the least economic and strategic issues - exposed and discussed in previous chapters - would be that of a 210 degree generated MWDC, defined by 8 planes and 21 satellites per plane. This configuration was found optimizing the whole Earth in order to have full coverage without gaps (except for the limitations of this model at high latitudes). An important consideration is that we also analysed other Mixed Walker Delta Configurations for 225 and 240 degrees, but these resulted in a more expensive distribution of satellites.

\section{Angle of elevation}

\paragraph{ }

The angle of elevation is essential to calculate the geometry of our constellation. As discussed previously, our aim in this project report is to justify how global coverage will be fulfilled. First, we define for a given groundstation the angle between its beam pointing right to the satellite and the horizontal local plane as the elevation angle. Secondly, a study is conducted in order to relate the height of the satellite, the elevation angle and the coverage of the Earth. Finally, we complete our orbital design by configuring a constellation that will securely define a global coverage fulfillment. Next, we will be defining how these parameters are related. 


\subsection{Elevation angle cone}

\paragraph{ }

Global coverage will be discussed considering the elevation angle and its resulting footprint on Earth. The elevation angle is described by the angular orientation of the antennas in the ground station. However, this angle is also perceived by the satellite in a similar way - it will vary depending on the orientation of the satellite and the angle between horizontal local planes. In order to describe the footprints we must define a cone which vertex is set at the antennas of the satellite, pointing down to Earth, and which generatrix is given by the angle of elevation. This elevation angle based cone is the description of the paths that our communications can take place. In other words, the generatrix of this cone is setting the limits in which the antenna will operate as function of the elevation angle. This implies that our satellite will be able to communicate to all the points contained in the cone. Finally, this cone will be describing a circular surface on top of the Earth which we will call the footprint of the satellite. Additionally, this footprint is the coverage that a single satellite can generate, hence we will be distributing satellites all around the Earth in order to fulfill global coverage. 

\subsection{Atmospheric restrictive conditions}
In order to obtain the final restrictive angle of elevation needed to contact the ground stations some considerations have to be made. First, a description of the different atmospheric conditions will be defined. Then, we will relate these to our bandwidth in order to analyse if they must be taken into account when communicating with ground stations. [elec2013cantero]
\paragraph{    }
-\textbf{ Atmospheric gases: }water vapour and oxygen absorptions; important when frequencies are above 3 GHz. More info [64] and [07328546]\vfill

-\textbf{ Precipitations and Clouds: }these conditions are relevant for signals above 10GHz. \vfill

-\textbf{ Cross Polarization Discrimination: }direct consequence of both terrestrial links and rain. Related to non-spherical rain drops which have a polarization rotated towards the component of the major axis, and hence may attenuate a signal wave. \vfill

-\textbf{ Scintillation } is a rapid fluctuation in signal amplitude at low elevations. \vfill

-\textbf{ Radio Refracting Index: } for elevation angles below 3 degrees (especially those below 1 degree) and depending on the latitude of our satellite we may find big signal losses due to the resulting differential ray bending. \vfill


-	\textbf{Ionosphere layers: }
\paragraph{}

\textbf{D layers:} 60-90km. Considerable signal absorptions for 10 MHz and below, with progressively less absorption at hihger frequencies and oblique incidencies.\vfill

\textbf{E layers:} 90-150 km. Absorptions relevant for frequencies lower than 10 MHz, although for sporadic E propagations this value may be increased to 50MHz.  \vfill	

\textbf{Sporadic E layers:} Reflections of radio waves in this thin-cloud small layer may reach to frequencies up to 225MHz. These layers are usually formed following the E layers altitudes. \vfill

\textbf{F layers:} 150-500 km and higher. No absorptions or reflections for these layers. The F2 region allows the longest communication paths, above 210km of altitude.  

\subsection{Elevation angle of other current constellations}

\paragraph{}

Analysing the elevation angle necessary in order to fulfill global coverage requieres, as mentioned before, that we understand first the restrictive conditions of the atmosphere and how these will alter it. As a consequence of the different physical conditions given before we will be able to determine a relation between latitude and elevation angle. All the same, the elevation angle depends on the bandwith in which the satellites operate, hence different distributions of this angle respect to the latitude will be described depending on the bandwidths used. 

Comentar per sobre com són cadascuna, a quina ens apropem més i justificar que l'elevation angle maxim que farem servir és d'aproximadament 20 graus com a conseqüència de les limitacions atmosfèriques, que és menys restrictiu en qualsevol cas que les dissenyades per obtenir global coverage amb el model de MWDC.
